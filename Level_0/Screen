Level 0: "A little something to get you started"
Difficulty: Trivial

By looking at the page's source code or in the "Application" section (as I did), you can see an image called background.png. If we open it, we can find the first FLAG.
In the first level, there is only one flag, so once you find it, the level will be completed.
