# Hacker101_CTF
Hacker101 CTF (Capture The Flag) is a free online challenge offered by HackerOne to help aspiring ethical hackers improve their penetration testing and bug hunting skills.
# How does it work?
It consists of a series of interactive labs with simulated vulnerabilities.
Your goal is to find the vulnerabilities and capture the "flags", which are hidden text strings.
When you find a flag, you submit it on the platform to earn points.
This CTF consists of 26 levels (trivia, easy, moderate, hard, expert), and each level can contain between 1 and 12 flags.

An example of a flag: ^FLAG^kdgur98ut4gdrRkfTDheifihRT4oi3jif@RÂ£2hweoiDSjd329f4uhi$FLAG$

When you find one of these flags, you must enter it in this section (see the image below) to confirm the flag you found.
